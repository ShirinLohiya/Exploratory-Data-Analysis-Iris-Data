# Iris Dataset EDA Analysis

 # 📌 Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset. The analysis includes data visualization, summary statistics, and insights into the dataset's features and relationships.

📂 Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). Each sample has four features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

The following steps are performed in this project:

Loading the dataset using Pandas

Checking for missing values and data types

Summary statistics of numerical features

Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Pair plots to show relationships

Histograms and KDE plots for feature distributions

Box plots to detect outliers

Correlation heatmap

Insights and observations
